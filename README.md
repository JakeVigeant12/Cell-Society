### Running the Program

Main class: Main.java

How to use the program: Run the Main.java class. From there, a pop-up should appear with the main menu. There, a language can be selected. From there, a sim file can be uploaded.

Once the sim file is uploaded, if sucessfully uploaded with proper formatting, the grid and the UI will appear. To play the simulation, press play. To pause, press pause. To step forward one frame at a time, press the step function. To speed up the simulation, use the slider to speed it up. To save the current configuration of cells to a CSV, then press the save button. The user can easily exit, go back, and upload a new simulation with the top bar. The user can also view the information from the sim file using the panel on the left.

Data files needed: 
* A sim file and corresponding csv with the grid states

Features implemented:

Fully working simulations:
 * Conway's Game of Life
 * Spreading of Fire
 * Rock, Paper, Scissors
 * Percolation
 * Schelling's Model of Segregation

Nearly Complete Simulations:
 * Wa-Tor World
