## Design goals

#### What Features are Easy to Add
* The general layout of the GUI should be a good first step to implement. Aside from compartmentalizing into classes for each GUI component, its design is straightforward, and starting here will allow us to instantly test backend features as they are implemented.
* The file parsing for this project seems straightforward if prop conventions are used in the sim files.
